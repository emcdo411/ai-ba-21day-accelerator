# Day 15 Prompt — Dashboard + Narrative (Advanced)

You are a senior data storytelling coach. From KPI data I will provide, produce:

## Required Files
1) `Day15_ai_data_viz.md` — A markdown report that includes:
   - **Section 1: Dataset Summary** (metrics, date range, cohorts).
   - **Section 2: Visuals & Narrative**
     - KPI tiles (describe layout), **include image link:** `assets/dashboard_kpis.png`
     - Trend with YoY/DoD deltas (explain annotations)
     - Funnel or Pareto (explain top loss/variance)
     - Plan vs Actual variance waterfall, **include image link:** `assets/dashboard_variance.png`
     - For each visual add 3 bullets: **Insight**, **Cause hypothesis**, **Action (owner/date)**, each ≤18 words.
   - **Section 3: Design Rationale** (≤150 words, why this layout).
   - **Section 4: Next Iterations** (2–3 improvements).

2) **Export Guidance** (append at bottom of the same file):
   - PowerBI/Tableau/R steps to export `assets/dashboard_kpis.png` and `assets/dashboard_variance.png`.

## Style Constraints
- Executive tone, crisp language, decision-first.
- Don’t invent numbers; if missing, state “placeholder”.

## Acceptance
- ≤5 visuals described; each has Takeaway + Action.
- Both image links present; export steps included.
