# Day 21 Prompt — Capstone Pack (v2)

You are preparing a **9-slide portfolio talk** (7–10 minutes). Produce the following files with exact names and structures:

---

## File 1: `Day21_capstone_presentation.md`

### Slide Track (9 Slides)
- Provide slide titles and talking points.  
- Each slide: ≤4 bullets, ≤12 words each.  
- Include **time estimate per slide** (30s–90s).  
- Sum of all slides = 7–10 minutes.  

**Slide Arc (must follow this structure):**  
1. Title & Hook (who you are, why this matters)  
2. Problem (context, why important)  
3. Problem (data/evidence of scale)  
4. Solution (design/approach)  
5. Evidence (screenshot or demo tie-in)  
6. Evidence (metrics/outcomes)  
7. Governance (policy, DPIA-lite risk, eval, red-team attempt)  
8. Risks & Next Steps  
9. The Ask (explicit decision or support needed)  

### Evidence List
- Repo-relative references (e.g., `assets/screenshot1.png`).  
- Each slide (4–8) must map to at least one evidence item (screenshot, chart, or demo reference).  

### Governance Section
- ≤150 words.  
- Must include: 1 policy bullet, 1 DPIA-lite risk, 1 eval scenario, 1 red-team attempt.  

### FAQ
- 3–5 questions with strong answers.  
- Each answer ≤50 words.  
- Must cover cost, technical feasibility, and governance/risk.

## File 2: `assets/demo_script.md`

### Demo Run Order
- 5–7 steps, each with:  
  - **Time cue** (e.g., “1:30–2:00”)  
  - **Action** (what to show: dashboard, API call, chart, etc.)  
  - **Narration** (what to say in plain English).  

**Example step:**  
- *Time 2:30–3:00 — Show dashboard tiles updating live. Narration: “This reduces reporting time by 40% for Ops.”*

## File 3: Export Guidance

Explain how to export slides into `slides/capstone_deck.pdf`:  
- Create slides using your preferred tool (PowerPoint, Google Slides, Markdown-to-PDF).  
- Ensure titles + bullets from `Day21_capstone_presentation.md` match exactly.  
- Save final export as repo-relative file: `slides/capstone_deck.pdf`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Story Arc**: 9 slides, structured, timeboxed (7–10 min total).  
- **Bullets**: ≤4 per slide, ≤12 words each.  
- **Evidence**: Repo-relative, each solution/evidence slide mapped.  
- **Governance**: 1 policy, 1 risk, 1 eval, 1 red-team, ≤150 words.  
- **FAQ**: 3–5 Q/A, ≤50 words each, covers cost, tech, risk.  
- **Demo Script**: 5–7 steps with time cues, actions, narration.  
- **Export Guidance**: Clear, repo-relative path (`slides/capstone_deck.pdf`).
