### Governance Section (≤150 words)
Our governance approach ensures trust and compliance. We enforce **policy** restricting AI to pre-approved workflows. A **DPIA-lite risk review** identified potential bias in churn prediction, which we mitigated by balancing datasets. Our **evaluation harness** ran 10 test prompts, maintaining 80% accuracy. A **red-team test** simulated prompt injection; the system correctly refused unsafe input. This balanced approach keeps operations reliable and ethically sound.  

---

### FAQ (3–5 Questions, ≤50 words each)

**Q1. How much will this cost?**  
A: $250K budget, offset by $120K annual savings within 18 months.  

**Q2. Is the technology feasible at scale?**  
A: Yes, tested with 10K records/hour. Cloud infra scales horizontally.  

**Q3. How do we know it’s safe?**  
A: Governance includes policy, DPIA-lite, eval harness, and red-team defenses.
