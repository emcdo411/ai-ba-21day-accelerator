# Day 7 — MiniProject1: AI-Assisted BRD Draft (Advanced)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Pull together learnings from Days 1–6 into a **stakeholder-ready BRD skeleton**.  
- Show BA + AI fluency by producing a requirements document that could be reviewed in a real project.  
- Practice using AI as a **co-pilot**: accelerating drafting, validation, and critique without replacing BA judgment.  
- Create your **first portfolio artifact** to demonstrate your ability to use AI effectively in business analysis.

## 📘 Key Concepts

### BRD (Business Requirements Document) Core Sections
- **Problem Statement** → Why this project exists, framed in context.  
- **Scope** → What is in scope vs. what is explicitly excluded.  
- **Actors/Stakeholders** → Who is involved; optional RACI table.  
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (AC)** → Functional core of the requirements.  
- **Risks/Assumptions** → Expose known unknowns early.  
- **KPIs** → Tie requirements to measurable success.  

### AI’s Role for the BA
- **Drafting** → Generate first versions of sections quickly.  
- **Extraction** → Turn messy notes into structured user stories.  
- **Red-teaming** → Stress-test assumptions and risks.  
- **Rewriting** → Adjust tone for different audiences (technical vs. executive).

## 🛠 Hands-On (90–120m)

1. **Assemble Inputs**  
   - Day 1 → Core AI concepts & limits.  
   - Day 2 → Generative vs. Agentic framing.  
   - Day 3 → Token/cost awareness.  
   - Day 4 → Prompt engineering loop.  
   - Day 5 → User stories & AC.  
   - Day 6 → Industry case study with KPIs.  

2. **Draft the BRD Skeleton**  
   - Problem Statement (2–3 paragraphs).  
   - Scope (in-scope vs. out-of-scope bullets).  
   - Actor list (RACI table optional).  
   - 6–12 user stories with **testable AC**.  
   - Risks & Assumptions (≥5).  
   - KPI Targets (SMART).  

3. **Create the Risk Register**  
   - At least 5 risks documented.  
   - Each with impact, probability, mitigation, and owner.  

4. **Log Your Prompts**  
   - Keep your best 3 prompts in a log with explanations of why they worked.  

5. **Self-Critique (Review Notes)**  
   - Identify which sections are strong vs. weak.  
   - Note any AI hallucinations or gaps.  
   - Capture SME questions you’d need answered in a real project.

## 📦 Deliverables

Save all work in the `Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/` folder:

- `BRD_v1.md` → Core BRD (problem, scope, actors, user stories, AC, KPIs, risks).  
- `risk_register.md` → Risk log table (≥5 rows).  
- `prompts_used.md` → Top 3 prompts + explanations.  
- `review_notes.md` → Self-critique (strengths, weaknesses, SME questions).

## ✅ QA Check (Advanced Rubric)

- **Scope:** Clearly defined, including what’s excluded.  
- **Stories + AC:** 6–12 stories, each with testable acceptance criteria.  
- **Risks:** ≥5, realistic, each with mitigation + owner.  
- **KPIs:** At least 2 SMART metrics.  
- **Tone:** Stakeholder-ready; concise, no jargon.  
- **AI Evidence:** Shows use of AI for drafting, refining, and critiquing — not just copy/paste.

⏱ **Estimated Time:** 2 hours  
💡 **Tip:** This is your first *portfolio artifact*. Treat it as if you’ll share it with a VP or in an interview. It should feel review-ready, even if it’s still v1.
