# Day 7 — MiniProject1: AI-Assisted BRD Draft (Advanced)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Synthesize learnings from Days 1–6 into a **full BRD skeleton**.  
- Demonstrate BA + AI fluency by drafting a requirements document that a stakeholder could actually review.  
- Practice using AI as a **co-pilot**: not replacing your BA role, but accelerating document drafting, validation, and critique.

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **BRD (Business Requirements Document):**
  - **Problem Statement** → Why this project exists.
  - **Scope** → What is included, what is excluded.
  - **Actors/Stakeholders** → Who is involved.
  - **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (AC)** → Functional core.
  - **Risks/Assumptions** → Expose unknowns early.
  - **KPIs** → Tie requirements to measurable success.

- **AI Role for BAs:**
  - Draft initial structure.  
  - Extract stories from messy notes.  
  - Red-team risks.  
  - Rewrite content for multiple audiences.

## 🛠 Hands-On (90–120m)

1. **Assemble Inputs:**  
   - Day 1 → Core terms & limits.  
   - Day 2 → Agent vs. generative framing.  
   - Day 3 → Token/cost awareness.  
   - Day 4 → Prompt engineering loop.  
   - Day 5 → User stories & AC.  
   - Day 6 → Industry case study.  

2. **Draft BRD Skeleton:**  
   - Problem Statement (2–3 paragraphs).  
   - Scope (in/out bullets).  
   - Actor List (RACI table optional).  
   - 6–12 User Stories + AC.  
   - Risks & Assumptions.  
   - KPI Targets (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).  

3. **Self-Critique (Review Notes):**  
   - Which sections feel weak?  
   - What assumptions did AI “hallucinate”?  
   - What do you need from SMEs?  

4. **Risk Register:**  
   - At least 5 risks.  
   - Each with impact, probability, mitigation, owner.  

5. **Prompts Used Log:**  
   - Keep a list of your 3 best prompts and why they worked.

## 📦 Deliverables

Inside `Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/`:

- `BRD_v1.md` → Core document (problem, scope, actors, stories, AC, KPIs, risks).  
- `prompts_used.md` → Top 3 prompts + explanations.  
- `risk_register.md` → Risk log table (min. 5 rows).  
- `review_notes.md` → Self-critique (strengths, gaps, next steps).  

---

## ✅ QA Check (Advanced Rubric)

- **Scope:** Clearly defined, includes both in-scope and out-of-scope.  
- **Stories + AC:** Minimum 6, AC are testable.  
- **Risks:** ≥5, realistic, include mitigations.  
- **KPIs:** At least 2 SMART metrics.  
- **Tone:** Stakeholder-ready, concise, free of jargon.  
- **AI Evidence:** You used AI to draft, refine, and critique — not just to dump answers.

💡 Tip: Think of this as your first *portfolio artifact*. It’s not just homework — it’s proof you can apply BA + AI together.
