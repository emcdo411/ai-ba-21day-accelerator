# Day 7 ‚Äî MiniProject1: AI-Assisted BRD Draft (Advanced)

## üéØ Objectives

* Pull together learnings from Days 1‚Äì6 into a **stakeholder-ready BRD skeleton**.
* Show BA + AI fluency by producing a requirements package that mimics a real project deliverable.
* Practice using AI as a **co-pilot**: drafting, validating, and critiquing without replacing BA judgment.
* Create your **first portfolio artifact** with multiple files that link cleanly in GitHub.

## üìò Key Concepts

### BRD (Business Requirements Document) Core Sections

* **Problem Statement** ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 paragraphs (‚â§250 words) describing context and why this project matters.
* **Scope** ‚Üí Clear in-scope vs. out-of-scope bullets (‚â•2 of each).
* **Actors/Stakeholders** ‚Üí Role list with a **RACI table (‚â•4 roles)**.
* **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (AC)** ‚Üí 6‚Äì12 concise user stories (‚â§25 words each), each with ‚â•2 AC in **Given/When/Then** format.
* **Risks & Assumptions** ‚Üí ‚â•5 documented items.
* **KPIs** ‚Üí ‚â•2 SMART metrics (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound).

### Risk Register

* At least 5 rows.
* Columns: **Risk | Impact (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation | Owner**.
* Each risk must include a mitigation strategy and an owner.

### Prompts Log

* Capture 3 full prompts you used (or could use).
* Explain why each one worked (‚â§50 words per explanation).

### Self-Critique

* 3 sections: **Strengths, Weaknesses, SME Questions**.
* Each section must have ‚â•3 bullets, each ‚â§20 words.
* Focus on clarity, completeness, and gaps AI cannot fill.

## üõ† Hands-On (90‚Äì120m)

1. **Assemble Inputs**

   * Draw from Day 1‚Äì6 learnings: concepts, costs, prompt design, user stories, KPIs.

2. **Draft the BRD (BRD\_v1.md)**

   * Problem, scope, actors/stakeholders (with RACI).
   * 6‚Äì12 user stories with ‚â•2 AC each.
   * ‚â•5 risks/assumptions.
   * ‚â•2 SMART KPI targets.

3. **Build the Risk Register (risk\_register.md)**

   * ‚â•5 risks, each with impact, probability, mitigation, and owner.

4. **Log Your Prompts (prompts\_used.md)**

   * Save 3 prompts + explanations.

5. **Write Review Notes (review\_notes.md)**

   * Strengths, Weaknesses, SME Questions.
   * ‚â•3 bullets per section.
