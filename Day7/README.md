# Day 7 â€” MiniProject1: AI-Assisted BRD Draft (Advanced)

Welcome to **Day 7** of your AI Business Analysis Accelerator.  
This is your first **portfolio-ready mini project**: using AI as a co-pilot to create a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**.  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Lesson Summary
- Draft a **stakeholder-ready BRD skeleton**.  
- Write **user stories with testable acceptance criteria (AC)**.  
- Build a **risk register** with mitigations and owners.  
- Track your **top prompts** to demonstrate AI fluency.  
- Write a **self-critique** to strengthen BA reflection skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables

Your work for today lives in the `Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/` folder:

- [BRD_v1.md](../Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/BRD_v1.md)  
  Core BRD skeleton (problem, scope, actors, user stories, AC, KPIs, risks).  

- [risk_register.md](../Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/risk_register.md)  
  Table of â‰¥5 risks with impact, probability, mitigations, and owners.  

- [prompts_used.md](../Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/prompts_used.md)  
  Your top 3 prompts + explanation of why they worked.  

- [review_notes.md](../Projects/MiniProject1_BRD_Draft/review_notes.md)  
  Self-critique with strengths, weaknesses, and SME questions.

## ðŸ›  Hands-On (90â€“120m)

1. Assemble inputs from Days 1â€“6.  
2. Use AI to help draft a **BRD skeleton** with all key sections.  
3. Document risks in a structured register.  
4. Log your **best prompts** and explain why they worked.  
5. Write your **self-critique** â€” this shows critical thinking and builds stakeholder trust.  

---

## ðŸ§ª QA Checklist
- [ ] BRD includes all required sections.  
- [ ] 6â€“12 user stories with **testable AC**.  
- [ ] â‰¥5 realistic risks with mitigations + owners.  
- [ ] At least 2 SMART KPIs.  
- [ ] Top prompts logged and explained.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
After completing this BRD package:  
- Be prepared to **present it to a stakeholder** in Week 2.  
- Expect to **convert it into diagrams, workflows, and UAT docs**.  
- Treat this as your **first portfolio artifact** â€” polish it as if youâ€™ll use it in an interview.
