# Day 7 Prompt — Advanced BRD Draft with AI

You are a Business Analyst tasked with drafting a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** using AI as a co-pilot.  

**Instructions:**
1. Draft a **BRD Skeleton** with these sections:
   - **Problem Statement** (2–3 paragraphs).  
   - **Scope** (bulleted list of what’s in, what’s out).  
   - **Actors/Stakeholders** (consider adding a RACI table).  
   - **User Stories** (6–12, with testable AC).  
   - **Risks & Assumptions** (≥5).  
   - **KPI Targets** (SMART).  

2. Generate a **Risk Register** table with at least 5 rows:  
   | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |

3. Log your **best 3 prompts** in a separate file and explain why they worked.

4. Write a **Self-Critique**:
   - What feels strong?  
   - What feels weak?  
   - What information would you need from SMEs?
