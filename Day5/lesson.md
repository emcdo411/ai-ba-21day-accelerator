# Day 5 — AI for Requirements Gathering

## 🎯 Objectives
- Use AI to transform messy notes into structured requirements.
- Learn to generate **user stories**, **acceptance criteria (AC)**, and **open questions**.

## 📘 Key Concepts
- **User Story**: “As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].”
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Must be testable.
- **Open Questions**: Reduce ambiguity.

## 🛠 Hands-On
1. Paste a stakeholder note (3–5 sentences).
2. Prompt AI to:
   - Generate 6–10 user stories.
   - Add testable AC.
   - List 10 open questions.
3. Red-team the output (what’s vague?).

## 📦 Deliverable
- `Day05_ai_for_requirements.md`.

## ✅ QA Check
- AC are **testable**.
- Open questions are **specific**.
