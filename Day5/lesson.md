# Day 5 â€” AI for Requirements Gathering

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Use AI to transform vague stakeholder notes into **structured, testable requirements**.
* Practice writing **user stories**, **acceptance criteria (AC)**, **open questions**, and **self-critiques**.
* Learn to spot **risks, gaps, and assumptions** in early requirements.

## ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts

* **User Story**: *As a \[actor], I want \[feature], so that \[benefit].* (â‰¤25 words)
* **Acceptance Criteria**: Written in **Given/When/Then** format, testable, â‰¥2 per story.
* **Open Questions**: Exactly 10, grouped by theme (Technical, UX, Business, Compliance).
* **Self-Critique**: â‰¥3 bullets (missing, risky, assumptions), each â‰¤20 words.

## ðŸ›  Hands-On

1. Start with a short stakeholder note (e.g., 3â€“5 sentences).
2. Prompt AI to:

   * Generate **6â€“10 user stories** using the standard template.
   * Add **â‰¥2 testable AC per story**, numbered (AC-1.1, AC-1.2).
   * List **10 open questions**, grouped by theme, â‰¤15 words each.
   * Red-team the output with **â‰¥3 self-critique bullets**.
3. Ensure formatting: tables, numbering, and markdown headings are clear.
