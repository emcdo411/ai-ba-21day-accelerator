# Day 10 Prompt — Current & Target Process Maps (v2)

You are a **Process Analyst**. From my notes, produce one markdown file with **two Mermaid diagrams** and export guidance.

---

## File: `Day10_ai_process_maps.md`

### Section 1: Current State Diagram
- Mermaid diagram with **6–12 nodes**.  
- Each node labeled with **lane prefix** (e.g., `Cust:`, `Ops:`, `Fin:`).  
- Node labels ≤5 words each.  
- Add **3 bottleneck comments** using Mermaid syntax (`%%`) placed directly above the affected node(s).  
- Provide a short markdown explanation (2–3 sentences) above the diagram.  

### Section 2: Target State Diagram
- Mermaid diagram with **≤8 nodes**.  
- Must use the same lane prefixes for continuity.  
- Show **reduced handoffs** and **simplified flow**.  
- Add **2 improvement comments** (`%%`) inside the diagram.  
- Provide a short markdown explanation (2–3 sentences) above the diagram, restating the improvements in plain English.  

### Section 3: Export Guidance
Provide steps for students to reproduce diagrams in Lucid or Visio and export them as PNG files:  
- Verify diagrams render correctly in GitHub preview.  
- Recreate diagrams in Lucid/Visio (using swimlanes if available).  
- Export to PNG.  
- Save files as:  
  - `Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_current.png`  
  - `Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_target.png`  
- Confirm images appear locally before submission.

## Output Format
- One ```markdown``` block named `Day10_ai_process_maps.md` containing:  
  - Current state explanation + diagram  
  - Target state explanation + diagram  
  - Export guidance  

---

## Acceptance
- **Current State**: 6–12 nodes, lane prefixes, ≤5 words each, 3 bottleneck comments.  
- **Target State**: ≤8 nodes, lane prefixes, 2 improvement comments, simplified vs. current.  
- **Explanations**: 2–3 sentences above each diagram, improvements/bottlenecks noted in plain English.  
- **Export Guidance**: clear steps, correct repo-relative PNG paths.  
- **File structure**: both diagrams + guidance in one markdown block named `Day10_ai_process_maps.md`.
