# Day 10 Prompt â€” Current & Target Process Maps

You are a process analyst. From my notes, produce:

1) **Current State Diagram (Mermaid)**
   - < 12 nodes, lane prefixes in node labels (e.g., Cust:, Ops:, Fin:)
   - Comment 3 bottlenecks in Mermaid comments.
   - Filename: `Day10_ai_process_maps.md` (include explanation above diagram)

2) **Target State Diagram (Mermaid)**
   - Reduced handoffs, fewer nodes; call out 2 improvements.
   - Append to `Day10_ai_process_maps.md`

3) **Export Guidance**
   - Short steps to reproduce in Lucid/Visio and export PNGs to:
     - `Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_current.png`
     - `Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_target.png`

### Output Format
- One ```markdown``` block named `Day10_ai_process_maps.md` containing both Mermaid diagrams and notes.

### Acceptance
- Diagrams render; bottlenecks and improvements explicit; export steps clear.
