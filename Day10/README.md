# Day 10 — Process Mapping with AI (Mermaid, Lucid, Visio)

Turn rough notes into **board-ready** visuals. Your goal today is *clarity with restraint*: fewer nodes, clearer handoffs, and a narrative that makes decisions obvious.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Convert text/process notes into diagrams your execs can skim in 30 seconds.
- Keep node count lean (target **< 12** per diagram).
- Make **handoffs and bottlenecks** painfully clear.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts (What “good” looks like)
- **Swimlanes by actor (lightweight):** Use prefixes in node labels, e.g., `Cust:`, `Ops:`, `Fin:`, `Eng:`. (Mermaid “true lanes” are limited; prefixes are the simplest board-clean pattern.)
- **Handoff risk:** Any edge (arrow) that crosses actor prefixes is a potential delay, queue, or rework point.
- **Two views only:** `Current` (warts and all) and `Target` (reduced handoffs, clearer controls).

---

## 📥 Inputs You Need
- Meeting notes, BRD excerpts, or a bullet list of steps.
- The 3–5 actors involved (`Cust`, `Ops`, `Fin`, `Eng`, `Vendor`, etc.).
- 2–3 key KPIs tied to the flow (e.g., **Lead time**, **First-pass yield**, **Drop-off rate**).

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- `Day10_ai_process_maps.md` — both diagrams + notes + export guidance.
- `../Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_current.png`
- `../Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_target.png`

> Keep images in `Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/` so they travel with the Week 2 project.

## 🚦 Quality Gates (QA Checklist)
- [ ] **Nodes < 12** per diagram  
- [ ] **Actor prefixes** used consistently (Cust:/Ops:/Fin:/Eng:)  
- [ ] **Handoffs** (cross-actor edges) are labeled and intentional  
- [ ] **3 bottlenecks** identified with **2 fixes** each  
- [ ] **KPI impact** noted under each diagram

---

## 🧭 Workflow (20–45 min)

### 1) Rough list (5–10 min)
List the *real* steps as bullets; add the actor prefix on each line.

```

Cust: Submit order
Ops: Validate payment
Fin: Capture funds
Ops: Fulfill order
Ops: Ship & confirm

````

### 2) Draft the **Current State** (5–10 min)
- Keep it honest (retries, manual checks, etc.).
- Use **≤ 12 nodes**.
- Add comments (`%%`) to mark bottlenecks and risks.

### 3) Draft the **Target State** (5–10 min)
- Merge or remove low-value steps.
- Reduce cross-lane hops.
- Add automation/guardrails where they lower risk or time.

### 4) Note **3 bottlenecks** + **2 fixes each** (5 min)
- Tie each fix to a KPI (e.g., “Lead time ↓ 20%”).

### 5) Export PNGs (5 min)
Follow the steps in **Exporting to PNG** below.

## 🧩 Mermaid — Current vs Target (Copy/Paste)

### Current State (≤ 12 nodes)
```mermaid
%% Current State - keep < 12 nodes; mark bottlenecks with %% comments
flowchart LR
  classDef lane fill:#f3f6ff,stroke:#c6d0f5,color:#1d2b53,stroke-width:1;

  C1["Cust: Submit Order"]:::lane --> O1["Ops: Validate Payment"]:::lane
  %% Bottleneck 1: Manual validation adds queue delay (avg +12h)
  O1 --> F1["Fin: Capture Funds"]:::lane
  %% Bottleneck 2: Settlement failures trigger manual re-entry
  F1 --> O2["Ops: Fulfill Order"]:::lane
  O2 --> O3["Ops: Manual Pack & Label"]:::lane
  %% Bottleneck 3: Manual labeling error rate 7-10%%
  O3 --> C2["Cust: Receive Confirmation"]:::lane
````

**Bottlenecks & Fixes**

* **B1 — Manual validation (O1)**
  Fixes: (a) pre-auth rule engine, (b) auto-risk scoring → human-in-loop only on “amber”
  **KPI:** Lead time ↓; Rework ↓
* **B2 — Settlement failures (F1)**
  Fixes: (a) automatic retry/backoff, (b) vendor alert with payload hash (idempotency)
  **KPI:** First-pass yield ↑
* **B3 — Manual labeling (O3)**
  Fixes: (a) auto-label printer from WMS, (b) barcode validation gate
  **KPI:** Error rate ↓; Returns ↓

---

### Target State (leaner, fewer handoffs)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Customer
    C1["Submit Order"]
    C2["Confirmation & Tracking"]
  end

  subgraph Operations
    O1["Risk-Scored Pre-Auth"]
    O2["Pick-Pack (Auto Label)"]
    O3["Ship & Confirm"]
  end

  subgraph Finance
    F1["Auto Capture (Retry x3)"]
  end

  C1 --> O1 --> F1 --> O2 --> O3 --> C2
```

**Design Deltas**

* **Manual validation → risk-scored pre-auth** (amber → human-in-loop).
* **Auto capture with retry x3** (idempotency key = orderId+timestamp).
* **Auto label print + barcode verify** before ship.

**KPI Effects**

* **Lead time** ↓ 25–40% (fewer queue delays).
* **First-pass yield** ↑ 10–15% (retries + vendor alerting).
* **Error rate** ↓ 60–80% (auto-label + verify).

## 💬 AI Prompts (Copy/Paste)

### A) Notes → Current State Mermaid

> *“You are a process analyst. Convert these notes into a **Mermaid flowchart** with **< 12 nodes**.
> Use actor prefixes `Cust:`, `Ops:`, `Fin:`.
> Add `%%` comments for **3 bottlenecks** at the exact step where they occur.”*

### B) Current → Target (Improvements)

> *“Propose a **Target State** Mermaid with **fewer handoffs** and **automation** where credible.
> For each change, add a short bullet list of **KPI effects** (lead time, FPY, error rate).”*

### C) Bottlenecks → Fixes

> *“For each bottleneck, propose **2 fixes** with trade-offs, and map each to a KPI change.
> Keep each bullet **≤ 16 words**.”*

## 🖼️ Exporting to PNG (Mermaid → Lucid/Visio → PNG)

### Option 1 — Mermaid Live Editor (fastest)

1. Open the Mermaid Live Editor (any Mermaid-capable editor).
2. Paste each diagram block above.
3. Export PNG → save as:

   * `../Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_current.png`
   * `../Projects/MiniProject2_ProcessFlow/process_target.png`

### Option 2 — Lucidchart / Visio (exec polish)

1. **Import** the Mermaid as a starting point (or redraw with lane colors).
2. Add lane color tints and bold the handoff arrows.
3. Export PNG at **150–200 DPI** to the same paths as above.

> **Tip:** Keep labels short. Execs scan shapes, not paragraphs.

## 📝 What to Put in `Day10_ai_process_maps.md`

Use this outline:

````md
# Day 10 — Process Maps (Current & Target)

## Inputs & Actors
- Notes source; actors (Cust, Ops, Fin, ...)

## Current State (Mermaid)
```mermaid
...current diagram...
````

**Bottlenecks:** B1, B2, B3 (with 2 fixes each)
**KPI impact:** Lead time, FPY, Error rate (direction + rough % if known)

## Target State (Mermaid)

```mermaid
...target diagram...
```

**Deltas:** What changed and why
**KPI impact:** Expected directional change

## Export Steps

* Where PNGs were exported; any Lucid/Visio polish applied

## Open Questions

* Data needed to confirm deltas; external constraints; vendor limits

```

## 🧪 Review Rubric (pass/fail)
- **Clarity (40%)** — lanes obvious, < 12 nodes, labels terse.  
- **Truth (30%)** — current state matches reality; target is feasible.  
- **Risk (20%)** — bottlenecks and handoffs explicitly called out.  
- **KPI link (10%)** — each improvement tied to a measurable effect.

---

## ❗ Common Mistakes (and fixes)
- **Too many nodes** → merge micro-steps; only show decisions that change flow.  
- **Vague handoffs** → put the **actor prefix** in every node label.  
- **No KPI link** → add a one-line KPI under each improvement.  
- **Wall of text** → labels ≤ 5–7 words; elaboration goes under the diagram.

---

## ✅ Done When
- You can *explain* both diagrams in **60–90 seconds**, pointing to **3 bottlenecks** and **how the target fixes them**.
```
