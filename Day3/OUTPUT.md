## Glossary (5 Terms)

- **Token** — The smallest unit of text an AI reads, like a word piece.  
- **Embedding** — A numeric fingerprint that captures meaning for search or comparison.  
- **Vector Search** — Finding the closest matches by comparing embeddings in a database.  
- **Latency** — The time it takes for an AI to respond to your request.  
- **Cost** — The amount charged for AI use, usually based on token volume.

## Cost Table

| Prompt | Token Estimate | Cost (USD) |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Short: "Summarize login requirements." | 30 | $0.000 |
| Long: 500-word requirement doc | 650 | $0.001 |

*Estimates use ~4 characters ≈ 1 token. Costs rounded to 3 decimals.*

## Reflection Paragraph

For Business Analysts, understanding prompt cost is critical because it directly affects **budgeting** and long-term **scalability**. A single prompt may seem cheap, but repeated thousands of times across workflows or projects, costs compound quickly. By monitoring token usage and controlling prompt size, BAs help balance accuracy with efficiency, ensuring solutions are both affordable and sustainable.
