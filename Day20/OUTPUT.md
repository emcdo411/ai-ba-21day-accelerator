# âœ… Day 20 â€” Resume & LinkedIn Upgrade (Sample Output for Students)

> This is a model of what your Day 20 deliverables should look like.  
> - All bullets are **quantified** (verb + metric + outcome).  
> - Word limits are respected.  
> - Placeholders (`{{Role}}`, `{{Metric}}`, `{{Outcome}}`) are used where real data isnâ€™t available.  
> - Cross-file consistency: bullets here appear identically in `resume.md`, and the About section appears identically in `linkedin_about.md`.

### Section A: Guidance Summary (â‰¤150 words)
Strong resumes highlight **impact, not activity**. Lead every bullet with an action verb, add a measurable metric, and close with the business outcome.  
Example: *Reduced onboarding time by 30% by automating training modules, saving $50K annually.*  
For LinkedIn, your **headline** should combine credibility, niche, and measurable results. Your **About** section should tell a story in three parts: who you help, proof with a case study, and what youâ€™re building now.
