# Day 6 Prompt — Advanced Industry Case Studies

You are a Business Analyst evaluating AI opportunities in a low-AI adoption sector.  

**Instructions:**
1. Choose ONE sector: construction, automotive, retail, or healthcare.  
2. Generate **3 AI use cases** for this sector.  
3. For each, complete the table:
   - **Use Case**
   - **Impact** (how does it create value? quantify if possible)
   - **Risk** (what could go wrong? compliance, adoption, accuracy)
   - **Data Needs** (specific data types and sources required)
   - **KPI** (1 measurable success metric)

**Stretch Goal:**  
For your strongest use case, write a **mini business case**:
- Problem statement (2–3 sentences).  
- Proposed AI solution (2–3 sentences).  
- KPI target (e.g., “reduce material waste by 15% in 6 months”).  
- Risk mitigation strategy.  

---

**Output format:**

### Table
| Use Case | Impact | Risk | Data Needs | KPI |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----|
| Example: Predictive Safety Alerts | Fewer onsite injuries, lower insurance costs | Alerts might be ignored; requires sensor accuracy | IoT sensor data, historical accident logs | OSHA-reportable incidents per 1M work hours |

### Mini Business Case
- **Problem Statement:** ...  
- **AI Solution:** ...  
- **KPI Target:** ...  
- **Risk Mitigation:** ...

---

**QA Check:**  
The table should clearly tie each use case to a business KPI.  
The mini business case should be written in **stakeholder-ready language** (no jargon).
