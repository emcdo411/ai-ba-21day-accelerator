## Table

| Use Case | Impact | Risk | Data Needs | KPI |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----|
| Predictive Safety Alerts | Reduce onsite injuries 20%, lower insurance costs | Alerts ignored; sensor accuracy may fail | IoT sensors, historical incident logs | OSHA-reportable incidents per 1M hours |
| Smart Material Tracking | Cut material waste by 15%, improve margins | Supply chain data may be incomplete | Inventory systems, supplier reports | % reduction in material waste |
| Equipment Failure Prediction | Reduce downtime by 25%, save $500K annually | Models may overpredict failures | Maintenance logs, manufacturer sensor data | Mean time between failures (MTBF) |

## Mini Business Case (Strongest Use Case: Smart Material Tracking)

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Construction projects often waste materials due to poor tracking and misallocation. This waste increases project costs and delays delivery timelines, reducing overall profitability.  

- **AI Solution:**  
  An AI-powered material tracking system can analyze inventory levels and supplier deliveries in real time, ensuring materials are allocated efficiently and reducing waste.  

- **KPI Target:**  
  Reduce material waste by **15% within 6 months**, improving gross margins by at least 5%.  

- **Risk Mitigation:**  
  Risk: Supplier data may be incomplete.  
  Mitigation: Establish data-sharing agreements and integrate manual spot-check audits.
