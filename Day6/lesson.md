# Day 6 — Case Studies (Low-AI Sectors)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore industries where AI adoption is *lagging* but opportunity-rich.  
- Learn to frame **use cases** that balance business value, risk, and data feasibility.  
- Practice building a **business case table** that ties AI directly to KPIs.  
- Strengthen critical thinking: not "where can AI go?" but "where *should* it go for measurable value?"

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **Adoption Curve**: Not all industries adopt AI at the same pace (tech → finance → retail → construction → government).  
- **BA Lens**: It’s not enough to say “AI can help.” You must define:
  - **Impact**: Revenue growth, cost savings, risk reduction, time saved.  
  - **Risk**: Data privacy, workforce pushback, regulatory.  
  - **Data Needs**: What *specific data* must exist for the use case to succeed?  
  - **KPI**: What number proves the AI was worth it?

## 🛠 Hands-On (60–75m)

1. Choose one sector: **construction, automotive, retail, or healthcare.**  
2. Research or brainstorm **3 realistic AI use cases**. Example (construction):
   - Predictive safety alerts.
   - Automated compliance reporting.
   - Demand forecasting for materials.  
3. For each use case:
   - Define **impact** (what improves, by how much).  
   - Define **risk** (why it might fail or harm).  
   - List **data needs** (structured vs. unstructured).  
   - Tie to **1 KPI**.  
4. Create a **5-column table** showing your analysis.  
5. Write a **mini-justification paragraph** for your strongest use case: why this, why now?

---

## 📦 Deliverable
- `Day06_ai_for_industries.md` containing:
  - 3 use cases in table format.  
  - At least 1 KPI per use case.  
  - 1 justification paragraph (5–7 sentences).

---

## ✅ QA Check
- Each use case includes a measurable KPI.  
- Risks are realistic, not generic.  
- Your justification is persuasive to a VP or stakeholder.
