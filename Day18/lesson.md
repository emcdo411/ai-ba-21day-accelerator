# Day 18 — AI for Stakeholder Communication

## 🎯 Objectives
- Communicate like an exec: decision-first, brief > essay.
- Produce an Executive One-Pager + 3 audience versions + FAQ + slide outline.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Voice & tone** per audience (CEO / Ops / Eng).
- **Decision-first**: lead with the ask and impact.
- **FAQ** to pre-empt pushback.

## 🛠 Hands-On
1) Draft Executive One-Pager (Problem, Options, Recommendation, Risks, Next 30/90).  
2) Rewrite for CEO (decision-first), Ops (how-to + owners), Engineering (risks/feasibility).  
3) Create 6-slide outline (title, 3 big ideas, decision request, appendix).  
4) Draft FAQ (10 Q/A).

## 📦 Deliverables
- `Day18_stakeholder_comms.md`
- Exports: `assets/one_pager.png`, `slides/pitch_deck.pdf`

## ✅ QA Checklist
- One-pager is skimmable; recommendation and next steps explicit.
- Audience rewrites ≤120 words each with consistent recommendation.
- Slide outline ties to the ask and metrics.

## 🗣️ Prompt Aid
“Rewrite for CEO (concise, decision-first), Ops (how-to + owners), Eng (risks/feasibility). 120 words max each. Keep the same recommendation.”
