# Day 18 — AI for Stakeholder Communication

## 🎯 Objectives

* Communicate like an executive: **decision-first, brief over essay**.
* Produce a **one-page policy-style Executive One-Pager**, **3 audience-specific versions**, **6-slide outline**, and **FAQ**.
* Learn to export content as clean, shareable assets.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Voice & Tone**: tailor the same recommendation for CEO (strategy), Ops Lead (execution), Engineering (feasibility).
* **Decision-First**: lead every section with the recommendation and expected impact.
* **Consistency**: the same recommendation must appear across all sections.
* **Constraints**:

  * One-Pager ≤400 words
  * Audience versions ≤120 words each
  * Slide outline ≤5 bullets per slide
  * FAQ answers ≤50 words each
* **Asset Paths**: reference exports as `assets/one_pager.png` and `slides/pitch_deck.pdf` (inline code, not links).

---

## 🛠 Hands-On

1. Draft the **Executive One-Pager** using Problem → Options → Recommendation → Risks → Next 30/90 Days.
2. Rewrite the recommendation into **three short audience versions** (CEO, Ops, Eng), each ≤120 words.
3. Create a **6-slide outline**:

   * Slide 1: Title & framing
   * Slides 2–4: Problem, Options, Recommendation
   * Slide 5: Risks & Mitigation
   * Slide 6: Request/Decision
   * ≤5 bullets per slide
4. Draft an **FAQ with 10 Q/A pairs**, each answer ≤50 words, covering common objections (timing, cost, risk, technical feasibility).
5. Write **export guidance** showing how to save the one-pager and slides into repo-relative paths.

## 📦 Deliverables

* `Day18_stakeholder_comms.md` (main file with all sections)
* Exports saved as:

  * `assets/one_pager.png`
  * `slides/pitch_deck.pdf`

---

## ✅ QA Checklist

* One-Pager is concise (≤400 words) with explicit recommendation and measurable next steps.
* Audience rewrites are ≤120 words each, in different voices, but carry the **same recommendation**.
* Slide outline is 6 slides, ≤5 bullets each, and ends with a decision/request.
* FAQ includes 10 Q/As, each ≤50 words.
* Asset paths appear in code format (`assets/...`, `slides/...`), not clickable links.

---

## 🗣️ Prompt Aid

“Rewrite the recommendation for:

* **CEO** (concise, strategic, decision-first)
* **Ops Lead** (execution, owners, timelines)
* **Engineering** (risks, feasibility, resources).

Each version ≤120 words, keep the **same recommendation**.”
