# ✅ Day 18 — Stakeholder Communication (Sample Output for Students)

> This is a model of what your `Day18_stakeholder_comms.md` file might look like.  
> - All sections are in **markdown only**.  
> - **Placeholders** (`{{Company}}`, `{{DecisionDate}}`) are used where real details would go.  
> - **Asset paths** are shown as inline code, not links, so there are no broken references.  
> - Word/bullet limits are followed so it feels like a real executive pack.

## Section 1: Executive One-Pager (≤400 words)

**Recommendation:** Approve migration of {{Company}}’s core app to a cloud-native architecture within 90 days.  
This enables faster releases, improved uptime, and cost savings.

### Problem
Legacy infrastructure creates high downtime risk and slows releases. Current uptime is 96% vs target 99.9%.

### Options
1. **Do nothing** — maintain status quo, risk outages.  
2. **Partial migration** — move non-critical workloads only.  
3. **Full migration** — shift entire core app to managed cloud.

### Recommendation
Option 3: Full migration.  
- **Impact**: +3.9% uptime, 25% faster deployments, projected $500K annual savings.  

### Risks
- Migration bugs may disrupt operations.  
- Training required for engineering team.  

### Next 30 Days
- Confirm vendor contracts.  
- Build migration plan.  

### Next 90 Days
- Complete phased migration.  
- Validate uptime and savings.

## Section 2: Audience Versions (≤120 words each)

**CEO (Strategy & ROI)**  
Recommendation: Full migration to cloud-native in 90 days. This ensures {{Company}} meets 99.9% uptime goals, speeds time-to-market, and saves $500K annually. The investment positions us for scale and signals resilience to customers and investors.

**Ops Lead (Execution & Timelines)**  
Recommendation: Approve migration of the core app in 90 days. Next 30 days: finalize vendor contracts and migration plan. Next 90 days: phased migration with rollback options. Risks: downtime and training gaps. Mitigations: dry-run testing and upskilling sessions.

**Engineering (Feasibility & Risks)**  
Recommendation: Full migration of core app to cloud-native stack. Timeline: 90 days. Expect training on new tools and phased deployment. Risks: initial bugs, resource constraints. Mitigation: sandbox testing, additional resourcing. Outcome: faster releases and improved uptime.

## Section 3: Slide Outline (6 slides, ≤5 bullets each)

**Slide 1 — Title & Framing**  
- “Cloud Migration: Unlocking Reliability & Speed”  
- Current pain: downtime, slow releases  
- Strategic urgency  

**Slide 2 — Problem**  
- Uptime 96% vs 99.9% target  
- Slowed release cycles  
- Competitive disadvantage  

**Slide 3 — Options**  
- Do nothing  
- Partial migration  
- Full migration  

**Slide 4 — Recommendation**  
- Full migration (90 days)  
- +3.9% uptime  
- $500K annual savings  

**Slide 5 — Risks & Mitigation**  
- Downtime risk → dry runs  
- Training gap → upskilling plan  
- Budget risk → phased spend  

**Slide 6 — Decision Request**  
- Approve migration now  
- Owner: {{Owner}}  
- Decision by: {{DecisionDate}}

## Section 4: FAQ (10 Q/A, ≤50 words each)

**Q1. Why migrate now?**  
A: Delaying increases outage risk and costs. Competitors are already cloud-native.

**Q2. What if migration fails?**  
A: Rollback plan ensures fallback within hours.

**Q3. How much does it cost?**  
A: Estimated $300K upfront, offset by $500K annual savings.

**Q4. What about data security?**  
A: Vendor is ISO/GDPR compliant. Data encrypted end-to-end.

**Q5. Will this disrupt customers?**  
A: Migration phased to minimize downtime. Dry runs scheduled.

**Q6. Can the team handle it?**  
A: Additional training + external contractor support included.

**Q7. How fast are savings realized?**  
A: Within 12 months through reduced infra and ops costs.

**Q8. What’s the ROI?**  
A: ROI expected within first year; cumulative gains grow after.

**Q9. What if competitors move faster?**  
A: This positions us competitively by closing uptime/release gaps.

**Q10. Who owns the outcome?**  
A: {{Owner}}, with Ops and Engineering support, accountable for delivery.
