# ✅ Day 4 — Prompt Engineering for BAs (Sample Output)

> This file demonstrates the structure you should follow for your submission.  
> - Use markdown tables for extraction and before/after.  
> - Keep rewrites concise (≤60 words).  
> - Critique with at least 3 sharp bullets.

## 1. Extraction Table

| Actor     | System         | Dependency               |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Customer  | Login portal   | Password reset workflow  |
| Ops Team  | Authentication | Identity verification    |
| IT Admin  | User database  | Third-party auth service |

---

## 2. Rewrite (Before/After Table)

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "We need to improve login because customers get locked out too much." | "Customers are frequently locked out of accounts. Improving login reliability will reduce support tickets by 25% and protect revenue from churn." |

*The rewritten version includes measurable outcomes (reduced tickets, revenue protection) and frames impact for executives.*

## 3. Critique Notes

- Missing: Expected timeline for improvements.  
- Risky: No detail on compliance/security requirements.  
- Assumption: Metric (25% reduction) is realistic without more data.
