# Day 4 — Prompt Engineering for BAs

## 🎯 Objectives

* Practice designing prompts to **extract, rewrite, and critique requirements**.
* Learn how to make requirements **executive-ready** with measurable outcomes.
* Build discipline in **structured formatting** (tables, bullets, concise rewrites).

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

* **Task Framing**: Always state the role (BA), output format, and constraints.
* **Structured Outputs**: Use markdown tables and bullet lists to avoid ambiguity.
* **Before/After Contrast**: Show how vague notes become clear requirements.
* **Red-Teaming**: Critique outputs to reveal missing info, risks, and assumptions.

---

## 🛠 Hands-On

1. **Extraction**

   * Identify **Actors, Systems, Dependencies**.
   * Present in a markdown table (`Actor | System | Dependency`).
   * ≤5 entries per column.

2. **Rewrite**

   * Rewrite requirement for a **VP stakeholder**.
   * ≤60 words, plain English, must show **impact + outcome + why it matters**.

3. **Critique**

   * Red-team the rewrite.
   * At least 3 bullets (≤20 words each) on **what’s missing, what’s risky, what assumptions exist**.

4. **Before/After**

   * Format original vs. rewritten requirement in a 2-column markdown table.
   * Ensure “After” uses measurable outcome language.

## 📦 Deliverable

* `Day04_prompt_engineering.md` containing:

  * **Extraction Table**
  * **Rewrite (Before/After Table)**
  * **Critique Notes (bulleted list)**

---

## ✅ QA Checklist

* Extraction table has 3 columns (Actor, System, Dependency), ≤5 items each.
* Rewrite ≤60 words, includes **impact + outcome + why it matters**.
* Critique has ≥3 bullets, ≤20 words each, covering missing info, risks, assumptions.
* Before/After table is clear; “After” shows measurable outcome language.
