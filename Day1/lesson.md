# Day 1 — What AI Can/Can’t Do (for BAs)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) actually do.
- Learn the difference between “pattern generation” vs. “reasoning.”
- Recognize where AI **fails** (hallucinations, outdated knowledge, bias).

## 📘 Key Concepts
- **LLM**: Predicts next word based on training data. Not a database, not truth.
- **Hallucination**: AI outputs something plausible-sounding but false.
- **Validation Loop**: Always verify against a trusted source or SME.

## 🛠 Hands-On (45–60m)
1. Pick a simple feature request (e.g., “add password reset to login”).
2. Prompt ChatGPT (or other LLM):  
   *“Summarize this request, extract actors, dependencies, and data touched.”*
3. Record what it gets right/wrong.

## 📦 Deliverable
- `Day01_intro_to_ai.md` with:
  - Glossary of 5–7 terms.
  - One paragraph on limits (hallucinations, context window).

## ✅ QA Check
Can you explain: **prompt → output → validation** in under 90 seconds to a colleague?
