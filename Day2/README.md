# Day 2 Prompt — Generative vs. Agentic AI

You are a BA designing an intake workflow.  

**Scenario:** A stakeholder submits a request for a new reporting dashboard.

**Tasks:**
1. Show how **Generative AI** (chat-based) might assist (e.g., summarizing the request).  
2. Show how **Agentic AI** (tools-based) might assist (e.g., parsing → storing in Jira → sending alert).  
3. Create a **diagram (text-based)** of the agent steps.  
4. List **5 guardrails** that prevent risky automation.

**Output format:**
- **Generative Use**  
- **Agentic Use**  
- **Agent Flow (diagram)**  
- **Guardrails (bullets)**
